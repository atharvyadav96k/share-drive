          <p>
            Shirdi, a quaint town in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, is one of India’s most revered pilgrimage
            destinations. Renowned as the home of Sai Baba, a saint who preached love, tolerance, and unity, Shirdi
            attracts millions of devotees from across the globe every year.
          </p>
          <h5>The Legacy of Sai Baba</h5>
          <p>
            Sai Baba, revered as a spiritual leader and mystic, lived in Shirdi in the late 19th and early 20th
            centuries. He is known for his teachings that transcended religion, advocating harmony between Hindus and
            Muslims. His philosophy of <strong>“Sabka Malik Ek”</strong> (God is one for all) continues to inspire
            followers to this day.
          </p>
          <p>Shirdi became a place of spiritual significance because of Sai Baba’s presence, and his Samadhi Mandir is
            now the town’s focal point.</p>
          <h5>Top Attractions in Shirdi</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir</strong>:
              <p>The Samadhi Mandir, where Sai Baba’s mortal remains were interred, is the heart of Shirdi. Built by a
                devotee named Shreemant Gopalrao Buti in 1922, this temple sees thousands of devotees daily who come to
                offer prayers and seek blessings. The serene atmosphere and devotional chants create a profound
                spiritual experience.</p>

                his message of unity, as people from all faiths are welcomed here. Dwarkamai houses an oil-lit lamp that
                has been burning since Sai Baba’s time.</p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Khandoba Mandir</strong>:
              <p>This temple holds historical significance as it was the first place where Sai Baba was recognized as a
                divine figure. It is dedicated to Lord Khandoba, a form of Lord Shiva.</p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Gurusthan</strong>:
              <p>Gurusthan, meaning “place of the guru,” is where Sai Baba was first spotted meditating under a neem
                tree. A small shrine now marks this location.</p>

          </ol>
          <h5>Festivals and Celebrations</h5>
          <p>The town comes alive during festivals like Guru Purnima, Rama Navami, and Vijaya Dashami (Sai Baba’s
            Punyatithi). These occasions see grand processions, devotional music, and rituals, drawing even larger
            crowds to Shirdi.</p>
          <h5>Best Time to Visit</h5>
          <p>The ideal time to visit Shirdi is from October to March, when the weather is pleasant. However, the temple
            is open year-round, and devotees often visit based on their spiritual calendars or personal commitments.</p>
          <h5>Tips for Devotees</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrive early to avoid long queues, especially during weekends and festivals.</li>
            <li>Follow the temple’s guidelines for dress code and photography restrictions.</li>
            <li>Make use of the Sai Baba Sansthan Trust’s accommodation and meal facilities for a comfortable stay.</li>

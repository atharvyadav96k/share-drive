          <p>
            Located on a rocky island just off the coast of Malvan in Maharashtra, Sindhudurg Fort is a magnificent sea
            fort that stands as a testament to the vision and military acumen of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Built in
            1664–1667, this architectural marvel was constructed to protect the Maratha Empire from foreign invaders and
            sea pirates. Surrounded by the serene waters of the Arabian Sea, Sindhudurg Fort is a symbol of Maratha
            pride and engineering brilliance.</p>
          <h5>Historical Significance</h5>
          <p>The fort was commissioned by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to establish a strong naval base and secure the
            Maratha coastline. Over 100 Portuguese architects and 3,000 workers toiled for three years to build the
            fort. Its location on the Kurte Island and its unique design make it a rare example of a strategically
            planned fort. The fort walls stretch over 2 miles, rising 30 feet above the sea level, and are nearly
            impenetrable even today.</p>
          <h5>Architectural Marvel</h5>
          <p>Sindhudurg Fort boasts a blend of military strategy and architectural ingenuity:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Hidden Entrance</strong>:
              <p>The fort’s entrance is cleverly concealed, making it difficult for enemies to locate. This feature
                demonstrates the strategic brilliance of its construction. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Massive Walls</strong>:
              <p>The walls of the fort, built using a unique mixture of lead and laterite stones, can withstand the
                force of the crashing waves and are resistant to erosion.

              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shivaji Maharaj’s Handprint</strong>:
              <p>Inside the fort, visitors can see an impression of Shivaji Maharaj's hand and footprint, which is
                preserved as a mark of respect for the Maratha king.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Temples Inside the Fort</strong>:
              <p>Unlike other forts, Sindhudurg houses temples, including those dedicated to Lord Shiva, Hanuman, and a
                unique temple of Shivaji Maharaj himself. This temple was built by Shivaji’s son, Rajaram Maharaj, and
                remains a significant attraction.</p>
